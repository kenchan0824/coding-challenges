Write a function solution that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of fragments of A whose sum equals 0 (this is, pairs (P,Q) such that P <= Q and the sum A[P] + A[P+1] + ... + A[Q] is 0). The function shuld return -1 if this number exceeds 1,000,000,000.
  
Examples:
  
1. Given A = [2, -2, 3, 0, 4, -7], the function should return 4, as explained on this picture:

> 2, -2, 3, 0, 4, -7  
> +----+   +-+  
>       +-----------+  
> +-----------------+  
  
2. Given A=[0, 0, ..., 0] of length 100,000 the function should return -1.
  
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [-10,000 .. 10,000]
